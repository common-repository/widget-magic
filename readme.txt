Provides a shortcode that allows sidebars to be used in any page or post.

== Description ==

Implements a set of WordPress shortcodes and theme additions that allow widget content (initially just sidebars but eventually any text) to be used in any page or post using simple shortcodes.

### Usage ###

For a sidebar:

    [show_sidebar id="<sidebar id>"]

= Attributes =

- *id*: the id or name of the sidebar to be shown.

== Installation ==

1. Install Widget Magic either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server. If uploading the files to your server create a `widget_magic` directory in your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and upload `widget_magic.php` into that directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Why Widget Magic =
I needed to reuse a specific piece of content in multiple places (specifically a sidebar in a page with no sidebar). This let me do that. In general Wordpress does not appear to make it trivial to reuse smaller pieces of content in multiple places.
